Future features:

Automated testing - looks like shoes doesn't make this easy.
Merits - should automatically select the lowest valid value.
UI - should be tabbed, I'm out of space to keep going this way...

I feel like I should really invert the namespace, like I've gotten it backwards.
Instead of Reference::Merits Model::Merits and Reference::Skills, it should be Skills::Reference, Merits::Model and Merits::Reference 
Have to think about this one.

Replace the ugly 'Remove specialization' buttons with some sort of 'red circle with a minus sign' button. Add a similar button to merits.
